            Hello my name is Austin Jackson,

            ${{secrets.MAIL_PERSONAL_INFO}}
            
            I am requesting the grade distributions by percent and/or letter grade, for every class and instructor for the Spring ${{ steps.timestamp.outputs.currentyear }} semester at the University of Houston. Please ensure the documents are FERPA compliant. I request that the information is in CSV format, and in digital format. Preferably in the form:

            Course Subject, Course Number, Course Title, Course Section, Term/Semester, Primary Instructor, A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, W, Average Grade in GPA, S (Satisfactory), NCR (No Credit Reported).

            Please note, I have included the "S" and "NCR" fields as part of the [Spring 2020 Interim Grade Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20210415040609/https://uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/student/interim-undergraduate-grade-policy/index). If including these fields is extra work or otherwise incompatible with your procedures, please do not include them as part of this request.

            In addition, if putting in that form is extra work, comma separated value format with the requisite information is acceptable.

            Please notify me of any expenses prior to incurring them.

            Thank you,
            Austin Jackson
