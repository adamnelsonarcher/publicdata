       Prerequisite:
      </strong>
      An introduction to the STOTT PILATES method of pilates.
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      STOTT PILATES incorporates modern exercise principles, and applies proven and accepted practices in biomechanics, rehabilitation and athletic performance enhancement into a comprehensive, systematic, contemporary approach to the original teachings.  STOTT PILATES exercises are designed to restore the natural curves of the spine and rebalance the muscles around the joints. This involves placing more emphasis on pelvic and scapular stabilization, and integration of all the parts of the body into one. Preparatory exercises and modifications allow the technique to be appropriate for many different body types and abilities, making it applicable to sport-specific training and everyday life.
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      This is a pre-requisite to the STOTT PILATES Certification Training.
