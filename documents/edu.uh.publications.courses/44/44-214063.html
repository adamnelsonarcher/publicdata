       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All health professionals, regardless of specialty, work in healthcare settings where social, economic, and political forces powerfully influence who becomes ill, from what, and how likely it is that effective treatment options are both available and can be applied to positive effect in any one patient. This course explores core concepts in the fields of social medicine, population health, and healthcare systems to better understand the prevalence and persistence of health outcome inequalities past and present and to ask what we might do now to support and sustain healthier communities into the future.
