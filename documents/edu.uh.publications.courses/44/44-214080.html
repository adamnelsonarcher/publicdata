       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course places our everyday experiences of food and eating within a broader human and natural history. We will consider how human societies have provided for one of their most basic needs using land and ocean resources, from early settlements to the contemporary era of “sustainable development.” Through a combination of online and classroom-based activities, students will learn and practice primary source analysis, find and utilize web-based historical research tools, and build historical arguments in writing. Students will also use historical methodologies to critically examine contemporary debates within the food industry as well as broader questions of social and environmental sustainability.
