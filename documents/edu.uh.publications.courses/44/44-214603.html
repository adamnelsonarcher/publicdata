       Prerequisite:
      </strong>
      At least six hours from the approved course list for the Certificate in Teaching English as an Additional Language (TEAL). ENGL 4303 Teaching English as a Second Language must be taken as part of the six-hour prerequisite. If students’ six hours of TEAL coursework do not include ENGL 4303, students must take ENGL 4303 as a concurrent course with the Practicum. Eligible students should make an appointment with the TEAL Director to discuss their career interests and possible practicum sites before enrollment in the Practicum.

       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Practicum course is a supervised work experience in the field of teaching English as an additional language.The Practicum focuses on classroom-based assignments and experiences to help students become reflective and proficient teachers of English as an additional language. The Practicum course can be fulfilled in a variety of ways based on students’ teaching interests and their target group of English-language learners. For example, students can be assigned to the Language and Culture Center (LCC), Houston-based communities and organizations that provide English tutoring to residents learning English as an additional language, English Dept. faculty working with students involved with learning and/or writing English as an additional language, or an English composition course. Students enrolled in the Practicum will be directly supervised by a professional working in a teaching capacity within the assigned site. This person will function as the Practicum student’s Site Supervisor. The Practicum Coordinator, most typically a faculty member from the Dept. of English, oversees student enrollment and site placement, as well as course content, and the weekly course meetings.
