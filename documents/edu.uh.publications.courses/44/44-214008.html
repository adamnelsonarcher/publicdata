       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course focuses on the social relationship of gender with social structure, systems, institutions, and cultural values related to food, eating and drink. The course will explore whether and to what extent the study of food and drink presents itself as a particularly insightful means of understanding gender dynamics, divisions and the construction of gendered identity. Because food and drink is part of our daily routine, the hybrid component of the course will allow students the opportunity to apply concepts to their lives as they revisit their eating habits, their family routines, their grocery stores, their restaurants and their on-campus eating patterns.
