       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course introduces important components of healthcare system and examines healthcare operations from systems engineering perspective. Topics include patient flow, patient safety, capacity management, inventory management and logistics, lean thinking, healthcare system performance measures and healthcare policy. Students will have chance to apply industrial and systems engineering tools to improve healthcare system and have better understanding of the role of systems engineering in addressing healthcare issues. This course emphasizes how different parts of the system interact with one another and to consider how changes made to one part of a healthcare system can have unintended consequences on other parts of the system.
