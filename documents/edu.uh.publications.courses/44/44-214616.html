       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The new paradigms of data science permeate our lives, from how we participate in social networks to how we pay for food, and yet most of us have no idea how it works behind the user interface. People who know what is happening, what choices are made and hidden from view, and who know how to use the data for the good¿that is, the ones who can critically engage with producing and interpreting data¿will have the advantage in the emerging society of ubiquitous data. This class will use project-based learning and real world examples to explore competing ways of modeling data and using data science to interpret and transform our world.
