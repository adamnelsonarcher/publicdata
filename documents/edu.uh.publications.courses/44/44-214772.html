       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course provides an overview of museums and the people who create, govern, and operate them. Through readings, lecture, discussion, and on-site visits, students learn about the different types of museums, how they have changed over time, and the challenges they face in preserving and presenting our historical stories for public audiences. Through a semester-long project, they gain hands-on experience in creating your own museum exhibit Â¿ from the selection of objects to the final presentation to stakeholders and a variety of visitors. Designed for students interested in museums and curious about museum careers, this course serves as an introduction to museums and the field of museum studies and encompasses fields as diverse as public history, anthropology, art, and public administration.
