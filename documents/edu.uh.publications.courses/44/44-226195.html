       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This gateway course to Southeast Asian American studies introduces students to the experiences of immigrants and Americans of Southeast Asian origins. In the course, students will learn about the histories of emigration and community making of US ethnic groups such as Hmong, Vietnamese, Khmers, Filipinos, Laotians, and Thais. By exploring the ways in which Southeast Asian Americans emigrate from their homeland and settle down in America, students will examine how US foreign affairs and immigration policies profoundly impacted these communities and appreciate their struggles and successes in the adopted country as well as their connection to - and memory of - the homeland.
