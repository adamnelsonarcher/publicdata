       Prerequisite:
      </strong>
      TEAL Practicum candidates must have completed a minimum of six credit hours of Teaching English as an Additional Language (TEAL) coursework, and formal approval from the TEAL Director, to enroll in the TEAL Practicum. Candidates should take Teaching English as a Second Language (ENGL 4303) as a prerequisite or, with special approval from the TEAL Director, may enroll concurrently in both ENGL 4303 and the TEAL Practicum.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the TEAL Practicum, the culminating experience for the Teaching English as an Additional (TEAL) program, candidates demonstrate competence and effectiveness in teaching English language learners (ELLs) in daily classroom practice. The practicum experience serves to integrate program content within the authentic teaching and learning environment. The crux of the course involves formal observation, support, reflection, and evaluation during candidatesâ€™ classroom teaching with ELLs, based on specific practicum assignments.
