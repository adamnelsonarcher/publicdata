      This course focuses in the development of a strategy to select materials and the course will have a focus on energy related applications. Students will use engineering methodologies to optimize the selection of material for a specific application. A major component of this course is the establishment of the main working parameters of each component as well as the expected performance while considering cost, weight, processing and design parameters as major limiting conditions for optimization.
