      This course is the first part of a two-semester course offered in alternate academic years. Students desiring to enroll are required to take both semesters. The fall semester will focus on the health policy development process, including researching and drafting a policy proposal on behalf of a non-profit community partner. Students will learn the skills to determine the best method to advance the policy proposal, whether through legislation or rulemaking. Grading will be based on several practical writing assignments (including a legal memorandum outlining the policy issue and possible solutions, a draft of proposed legislation, community support proposal, a letter to community partner, and a letter to a legislator).
      <br/>
