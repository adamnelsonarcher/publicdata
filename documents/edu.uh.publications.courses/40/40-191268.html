      It is impossible to examine the questions of migration without also paying critical attention to borders and the ways that borders are used to produce meaningful and consequential differences between places (so-called “nations”). By producing such spatial differences, borders also serve to produce social, political, and legal differences between distinct categories of people, such as “migrants”, “refugees”, “citizens, “tourists”, “business travelers”, “foreign students”, and so forth. As a result, the critical study of migration and citizenship are inseparable from one another, and neither can be properly understood without also examining borders.
