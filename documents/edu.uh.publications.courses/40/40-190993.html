      Corporate compliance, one of the fastest growing markets for legal services, addresses the problems of organizations struggling to manage risk ranging from corruption to data privacy. This class will teach you the process involved in addressing compliance risk and how to integrate compliance processes into a business. We will discuss a number of substantive compliance areas, but the goal of the class is to teach you how to develop a risk based approach to solve compliance problems.
