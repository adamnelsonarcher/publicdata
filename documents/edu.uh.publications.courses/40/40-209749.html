      This course is designed to expose diverse leaders to the policy and the practice of school discipline programs grounded in the theory of law and order and the criminalization of young people. Connections between theory and practice in the K-12 system will give students an opportunity to learn how to design equitable, and sustainable social, racial, economic and political justice in school culture.
