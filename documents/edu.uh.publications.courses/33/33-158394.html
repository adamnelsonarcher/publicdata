      This course surveys the development of space law and policy from the 1930â€™s to evolving law for the International Space Station and future exploration and settlement of the solar system. Topics include: International Space Law (multinational and bilateral treaties, and the common international law of space); National Space Law (US, Russian, European, Japanese and Chinese); and the space policy of the United States. US national space law is covered in detail, with specific attention to the NASA Act, FCC jurisdiction and control of communications satellites, FAA licensing of private launch services and policy issues related to remote sensing and the military use of space. Specific issues of patent, securities, tort and contract law are addressed in relation to current and future business activities in outer space.
