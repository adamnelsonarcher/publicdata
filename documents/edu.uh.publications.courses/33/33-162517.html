      Understanding the petroleum value chain and its life-cycle is vital to developing projects that have long-lasting beneficial impacts. In this course students will be introduced to the Petroleum Value Chain as manifested in a variety of project types (conventional and non-conventional developments including offshore deep water). Focus will be on the upstream, and challenges associated with each project type throughout its entire life-cycle will be discussed. Improvements in sustainability will be reviewed as well, through histories of oil and gas projects undertaken in the past.
