      In 1981, the first woman ever was appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Much has changed since then, including the personnel of the Court. This seminar allows students to explore both the jurisprudence of the changing Court and the viewpoints of its leading personalities over the past half century. Special attention will be devoted to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s legacy in American legal history, but students will be able to write papers about her jurisprudence and the jurisprudence of any of the 18 Justices (Ginsburg, Scalia, Kennedy et al.) with whom she served or who have succeeded her.
