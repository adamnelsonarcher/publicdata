      This course provides an introduction to U.S. energy law and policy. It looks at how energy sources (water, wind, sun, coal, oil, gas, nuclear) are extracted, transported, and converted into energy as well as the physical, market, and legal structures governing each energy source. It introduces the key jurisdictional actors that play differing roles in energy controversies and provides students with an understanding of pervasive multi-jurisdictional approach to energy regulation. Finally, it explores current hot topics in energy law and policy and opens a dialog to analyze how those topics are interrelated to other topics such as business and economics, climate and environment, human rights, and energy security.
