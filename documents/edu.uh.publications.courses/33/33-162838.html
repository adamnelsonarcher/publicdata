      This course is a systematic examination of the literature on race, ethnicity, and American politics. We begin with the concept of race and how it has been operationalized. We examine the history, political behavior, and representation of African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos in the modern political area. We also examine coalition building, citizenship, the role of political parties, and elections mostly in the U.S. context.
