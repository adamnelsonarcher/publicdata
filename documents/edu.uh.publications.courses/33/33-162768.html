      The goals of this course are (i) to introduce students to selected topics in the study of theology that conceptually parallel specific subjects in law and legal philosophy; (ii) to expand students’ understanding of how theological thought can inform legal inquiry, and how legal thought can inform theological inquiry; and (iii) to increase students’ awareness and enhance students’ comprehension of the variety of historical and contemporary approaches to resolving problems that have arisen in theological and legal thought.
