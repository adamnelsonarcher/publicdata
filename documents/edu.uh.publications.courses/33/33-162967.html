      This course is an introductory survey course of issues pertaining to educational disparities and social injustice (primarily in the United States). In this course, students will be encouraged to think critically and expansively about the social world and the conditions of humanity. This course is designed to enable students to develop an understanding of the theoretical, social, and historical roots of various  educational disparities and social injustice issues from multiple perspectives (e.g., education, public health, psychology, sociology), make connections, and to critically assess strategies for bringing about social change. Students will learn about historical and contemporary issues and empirical data at global, national, and regional/local levels. Moreover, by building personal awareness around their own biography, students will better understand how to identify and address educational disparities, and create a more equitable and just educational system for all students. Throughout the course, students will gain a better understanding of interventions to promote equity and social justice through a combination of readings, lectures, reflection papers, student presentations, class discussions, in-class exercises, and research assignments.
