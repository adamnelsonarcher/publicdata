Students will be provided with skills to recognize and analyze social and environmental impacts, and to identify key junctures where interventions can be made for positive outcomes. Issues to be addressed: ethnicity, power, gender, health, religion, social/environmental justice, petro-violence, transparency, and Corporate Social Responsibility.
