      A study of financial markets with particular emphasis on the markets for long-term securities. Topics covered include equilibrium forces in these markets, flow of funds, the connection between inflation and supply and demand forces, and theories of interest rate determination. Consideration is given to models that account for varying degrees of risk and expected levels of return. The role of financial intermediaries receives thorough examination throughout.
