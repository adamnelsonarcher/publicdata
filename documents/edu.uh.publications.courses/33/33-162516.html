      Continues the discussion of legal frameworks introduced in the Foundations course; covers specific provisions in host government petroleum contracts, industry-created Codes of Conduct, national laws of the host government, and international sources, such as the United Nations General Principles on Business and Human Rights. Will look at the role of key actors outside the industry, such as international NGOs, the EITI, the World Bank, and the United Nations, to gain an understanding of their impact on investors in the petroleum sector and to facilitate interaction with them. Objective of the course: to understand how “due diligence” in the application of these legal frameworks can reduce project risks and increase possibilities for long-term sustainability.
