      CHEM 1331 or equivalent.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Topics include: basic concepts and theoretical principles of stable isotopes (fractionation factors, mechanisms of isotopic exchange, etc.), characterization of stable isotope systematics for light elements (C, H, O, N, etc.) in different geological systems, including igneous and metamorphic rocks, waters and marine sediments, hydrothermal systems, biogeochemical systems, and extraterrestrial materials. Case studies and recent development of knowledge in this field will be emphasized.
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      Course materials consist of lecture notes, and supplementary reading list of book chapters and journal papers. Students will get hands-on operation experience with analytical instrument. Student learning outcome will be assessed by the combination of a closed-book exam and a term paper on a covered topic with 15-min presentation.
