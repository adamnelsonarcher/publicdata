      Even with petroleum and natural gasâ€™ enormous importance to our modern economy and lifestyle, hydrocarbon development and use remain tightly intertwined with environmental law and liabilities. For every inspiring engineering marvel in oil field development, hydraulic fracturing, and deep sea drilling, a counterbalancing memory arises of the oil-slicked shores of the Gulf Coast, the catastrophe of the Exxon Valdez, and growing fears over climate change caused by fossil fuel development and use. Simply put, a lawyer advising oil and gas interests (or opposing them) simply cannot provide reliable legal advice without an understanding of the environmental limits and liabilities accompanying hydrocarbon development.
