      This course focuses on Chinese language acquisition by English-speaking students in formal instructional settings. Readings include studies that investigate processes of acquiring Chinese as a second or a foreign language. Taught in English. The same course title may be co-offered at the 4000 level but students enrolled in this course are required for more substantial readings and to submit a lengthier research paper.
