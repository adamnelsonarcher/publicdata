      This graduate three credit hour course provides a through treatment of lumped parameter modeling of multi-domain systems. Here, mechanical, electrical, fluid and thermal systems lumped parameter models along with the integration of these single domain models to comprise a multi-domain complex-system-of-systems model will be studied. The so-called Tetrahedron-of-State approach will be used to create the course modeling content. Following the lumped parameter modeling aspects of the course, engineering tools and strategies associated with the simulation of the models will be developed. This course emphasizes a command-level understanding of systems simulation, performance prediction and Analysis Led Design principles too. Furthermore, the assessment, prevention and remediation of anticipated system faults will be investigated via simulations. The course outcomes include an ability to model multi-domain engineered systems, estimate system performance using state of the art simulation methods, and the knowledge to design engineered systems that eliminate, mitigate or re-mediate system failures encountered in engineered systems.
