       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course introduces students to a set of tools and techniques that systems engineers can use to better understand, control and improve the performance of engineering and other complex systems. The tools include system identification and delineation, system leverage points, causal loops and feedback, delays and oscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, emergent properties, patterns, events, and self- organization. Students will learn systems thinking is about understanding an issue by analyzing the whole, rather than the parts and how systems thinking explains the conflicting behavior of individuals, departments, businesses, and countries.
