       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Explore the making of modern representations and interpretations of the Bible. We will discuss biblical citations, interpretations, and reimaginings in a variety of forms, including art, literature, movies, music, comics, Internet culture, and advertising. Lectures will center on modern interactions with specific biblical texts, such as the creation narrative, the flood stories, the biography of King David, and the character of Jezebel. Students will also learn from one another; each student will be tasked with finding and presenting to the class a pop culture representation of a biblical text.
