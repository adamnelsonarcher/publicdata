      This course is an upper level writing class designed to prepare students for “real world” litigation practice after law school. In the context of a single federal court case, students will draft basic pleadings, some minimal discovery documents, a short motion for summary judgment and accompanying response, and a mediation statement. Lectures will cover requirements for these documents under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but also enable students to refine their factual investigation, legal analysis and drafting skills. Students will receive ample feedback and opportunities to rewrite certain assignments to further hone these essential practice tools.
      <br/>
