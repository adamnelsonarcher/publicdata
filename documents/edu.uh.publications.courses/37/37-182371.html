      Supreme Court Term covers between 12 and 20 cases from the Supreme Court’s most recent term. The fall 2014 course will therefore cover cases from the October 2013 Term. Cases will not be announced until the first day of class. The objectives of the class are to gain basic familiarity with a diverse range of subject matter of current interest or importance to the Supreme Court, and to examine judicial opinions deeply and critically. The course will be divided into two groups of cases, and students will be required to write one paper for each group. Each paper will deal with a single case on the syllabus, and must satisfy two objectives: first, it must situate the decision in the legal landscape of which it is a part; second, it must explain in careful detail either the principal strength or principal weakness of any of the case’s major opinions. Papers will be assessed based on their analytical content and quality of writing.
