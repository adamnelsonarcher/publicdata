      This course provides an introduction to how international law regulates or impacts energy activities. It analyzes the legal framework for trade and investment in the energy sector, as well as rules governing energy development, the climate, and the environment. This course will also provide an overview of corporate responsibility and human rights consequences of energy activities. We will focus on how public and private international law consider the various actors, socio-economic interests, and environmental concerns associated with the exploitation of energy sources and how domestic law can impact those interests and concerns. By the end of the semester, you will be able to critically assess the key legal issues around the exploitation of energy sources from a multidisciplinary and global standpoint.
