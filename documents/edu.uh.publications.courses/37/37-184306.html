      This course is designed to enable students to study, report on, understand, and apply current research, theory, and principles of identifying, segmenting, and working with publics. It helps students understand principles of segmenting publics as applied to the practice of public relations and other disciplines in communication; understand current research and theory related to different contexts of public relations practices such as activist public relations and conflict resolution; and learn different research methods of effective segmentation of publics in order to apply the results of such segmentation to future public relations campaigns.
