      This course will give law students the opportunity to learn how to practice in three different court systems (juvenile, criminal, and civil) and train students in three different types of records clearing procedures: (1) juvenile records sealing; (2) expunctions of adult criminal records; and (3) nondisclosure orders for adult criminal records. Students will be assigned clients and handle their cases from start to finish, including: (1) meeting with the client to explain the records clearing procedure and its effects and obtain necessary paperwork; (2) drafting all necessary pleadings; (3) assisting clients in obtaining court fee waivers; (4) both e-filing and in-person filing procedures; (5) attending court hearings; and, for students who are eligible for student bar cards, (6) presenting motions to the judge and arguing for the granting of records sealing applications.
