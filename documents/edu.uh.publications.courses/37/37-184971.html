      This graduate project-intensive course is inspired by the Senior Capstone Design course in the undergraduate curriculum. For this graduate course, each team of graduate students will partner with a team of employees at a local company who are already working on a challenging project given to them by their management. Together, this expanded team must develop solutions, validate them and justify them to the management of the sponsor company.
