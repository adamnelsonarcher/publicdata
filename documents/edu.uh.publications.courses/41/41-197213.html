       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This class considers biography as a lens through which to explore the contours of US history.  More than a designation of great Americans, biography offers historians a way to complicate how we think about ordinary and extraordinary lives.  Treating biography as a form of micro history, this course introduces new approaches to this classic genre by exploring historian-biographers works spanning US history.  In anticipation of creating our own biographical sketches, we will explore the unique qualities and particular difficulties of biographical writing as well as biographers source base including autobiography, multimedia texts, and oral history.
