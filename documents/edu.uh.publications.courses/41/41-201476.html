       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course provides students with an opportunity to learn about African history through the lens of one or more of the continentâ€™s creative arts. These can include drama, music, film, creative writing, graphic design, photography, and/or the visual arts. Comparisons between temporal genres of a particular artform will be made (i.e., classical, modern, contemporary, popular) so that students are exposed to not only the broader historical trajectories of Africa and its peoples, but also the historical development of a particular artform on the continent as well. Through a variety of readings, films, visuals, and performances students will learn how the experiences of colonialism, freedom struggles, and globalization impacted artists identities, intended audiences, goals and desires.
