       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      This course will focus on the relationship of race and nation beginning in the 20th century. In essence, it allows students to consider the long migratory history to Africa and its impact on nation formation. Its broad objectives are to examine the ways colonialism defined, informed, and influenced conceptions of race. It will also explore the ways African leaders re-envisioned citizenship during the independence era as well as reckon with its burgeoning neo-colonial relations. Simultaneously, this course is keenly aware of the racially inclusive contemporary use of the term African. More specifically, it contextualizes the ways Chinese traders, Indian indentured servants and merchants, African American settlers, as well as recruited immigrants and business magnates from various parts of European among others made Africa their home.
