       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      We explore the concept of illness narratives and how they might help with patient care. What constitutes a narrative? Why might narratives focusing on illness be different? How might the concept of ‘narrative’ help analyze the effects of illness and help us to communicate, perhaps to a patient, perhaps to a friend, possibly even to ourselves?
