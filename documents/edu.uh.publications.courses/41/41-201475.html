       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Jesus spent substantial time in Africa during his early years. We often hear nothing about this formative time. We do not often consider the ways Africa served as an important ministerial training ground or space of philosophical development. This course will examine Africa as a place with a distinct religious history.  In it, we will explore the long history of Christianity in Africa, while considering the place of other religions and spiritual practices alongside of it. It will consider African interpretations of religion, the history of religious organizing, and the ways African vintage points were and continue to be shaped by a unique social, political and economic context. Simultaneously, it seeks to arm students with a set of analytical tools that include close readings of sources, corroborating evidence from various places, and reading archival silences all while presenting it in the form of strong writing.
