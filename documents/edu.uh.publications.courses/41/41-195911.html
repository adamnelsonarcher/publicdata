      focuses on Army doctrine and team development. The course begins the journey to understand and demonstrate competencies as they relate to Army doctrine. Army Values, Teamwork, and Warrior Ethos and their relationship to the Law of Land Warfare and philosophy of military service are also stressed.  The ability to lead and follow is also covered through Team Building exercises in small units up to squad level. Students are then required to apply their knowledge outside the classroom in a hands-on performance-oriented environment during Leadership LABs (team building exercises, LTXs, VBS exercises).  Includes a weekly lab facilitated by MS III Cadets and supervised by Cadre.
