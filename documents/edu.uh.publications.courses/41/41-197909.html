       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Monetary policy affects all aspects of the economy: interest rates, inflation, unemployment, stock prices, and even income inequality. The Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, which sets monetary policy, is often called the second most powerful person in the United States. The course will consider how monetary policy is conducted in the United States and other countries, with particular attention to developments since the Financial Crisis and Great Recession of 2008.
