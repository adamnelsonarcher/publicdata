       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      An exploration of anthropological research and writing through the analytical and practical study of fieldwork and ethnography, this course provides students with the needed ¿tools¿ to help them investigate the lived experience of the Asian American community. Students will learn and mobilize various ethnographic methods and techniques, engage in ethnographic writing, and actively evaluate and guide one another¿s work. By doing so, we will pay attention to questions of knowledge, location, evidence, ethics, power, translation, experience, and the way theoretical problems can be framed in terms of ethnographic research in unique and complex Asian American cultures/subcultures. In a hands-on fashion, along the course, students will apply what they learn toward designing, conducting, writing, and presenting their own ethnographic research project on a local Asian American community.
