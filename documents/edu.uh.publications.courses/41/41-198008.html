       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The objective of this course is to introduce fundamental concepts in biochemical engineering. The course assumes that the students have a basic understanding of biomolecules. The course presents a basic understanding of enzyme mechanisms and kinetics. From there we will transition into cellular energetics and the thermodynamics of cellular energetics. Next, we will understand the underlying concepts of commonly used techniques in molecular and cell biology. The second half of the semester will focus on biopharmaceuticals including antibodies, proteins, and cells as drugs in the context of immunotherapy. We will learn the basics of immunology before transitioning into the use of the immunology in cancer immunotherapy. Finally, the course also introduces students to the use of statistics in study design and the use of the appropriate statistical tests for testing hypotheses and selecting appropriate graphs to represent data. The use of appropriate statistics to report the error and a discussion on significant figures will be presented.
