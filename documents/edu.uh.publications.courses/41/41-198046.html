       Description
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Students will gain technical skills through involvement in planning and implementation of data driven projects, including primary responsibility for data integration, acquisition, analysis, and pre- sentation. More advanced modeling of causal and inferential processes, including both initial workflow diagrams and presentations and visualizations that represent the entire arc of the project, will give structure to the course and provide the basis for evaluation appropriate to the desired learning outcomes.
