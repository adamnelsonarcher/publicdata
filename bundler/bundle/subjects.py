'''
Processes subject.json to be more accessible
by generating 2 alternative files:
- entries.json
    generate a large array of objects with the properties:
    - abbreviation

    ex: [{"abbreviation": "ARCH", "description": "Architecture"}, ...]

- dictionary.json
    generate a large dictionary where they the abbreviation
    is used as the key and the value corresponds to the description
    ex: {"ARCH": "Architecture", ...}
